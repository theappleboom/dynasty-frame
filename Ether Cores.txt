Ether Blast
Damage - 4
Radius - 4
Cost - 2
Cooldown - 4

Behavior:
Siege Cores have set Ether Cores that they will target throughout the game. Whenever possible, Siege Cores will use Ether Blast on all targeted unstable Ether Cores. Cost is the same no matter how many Ether Cores are attacked. Ether Blast hits a random destroyed Crystal and damages all enemies within its Radius.

Core Drain
Damage - 4
Cooldown - 4

Behavoir:
Siege Tempests have the same set Ether Core targets as when they are stable. Siege Tempests drain energy from all targeted stable Ether Cores, active or unactive. If Core Drain would sap more energy than an Ether Core has, left over drain is converted to damage done to that Ether Core's crystals spread evenly (ex. 2 drain left over will do 1 damage to 2 crystals or 2 damage to 1 crystal if only 1 crystal is left).
